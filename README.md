Game Visualizer Assignment for Game Engines  -------------------------     Student Name - Munfung


A playable game visualizer, with an alien invasion setting laying siege over upon a futuristic city in the night sky, lasers will be fired in every direction creating a massive laser lightshow and fantastical explosions in the night sky, with that in mind the game can be left on without being played, and have the background play by itself, with an ongoing war between the city and the extraterrestrial invaders

When engaged with, the player will spawn in as a mecha/fighter to fight off the initial alien invasion spawned in as background for visualization purposes, and then the enemies will spawn in waves from then on, until the last wave the boss will spawn in as a wondrous lightshow of a ship which will lay down a brilliant blinding siege upon the city and the individual parts will target the player as well, once defeated, you gain new interations to the game's visualizer system and return to the menu, where everything returns back to visualiser mode again.
